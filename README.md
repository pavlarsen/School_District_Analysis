# School District Analysis

In this school district, there are 15 high schools, with a total of near 15k students. With the data provided, it is possible to infer or test if there is a correlation between the type of school (charter or public), the budget each type of school has and the actual performance of the students either in math or reading skills. For this case, in general, charter school students tend to have a better performance in math tests from grades 9th to 11th. Then for the 12th grade, public school students tend to have better math scores. Regarding budgetary information, public schools have a little more budget on average than charter ones. Without more relevant data, we could infer that most of the budget for public schools could be implemented for 12th grade students in order to prepare them better for SAT's.

It would be interesting to have findings regarding how many girls or boys are at each type of school and their respective scores. Also, the socioeconomical level of each school location, could provide some insights on how well invested are the budgets each school has in order to increase the mean scores for math and reading.

By using Pandas, it is possible to perform data analysis in a quick matter.
